# Transaction Data Aggregator

This is my submission for the technical test for OnePay.

## Installation

You will need node v12+ as this uses the experimental ESM module loader to have nicer import/export functionality.

To aggregate the given data, simply run the following command in a terminal in the same folder as this readme:

```bash
npm start
```
